# CO experiment: resources and continuation

## Saved campaign — 6 October 2026

The calculation host is **Sadaharu**, reached with `ssh sadaharu` as `kooza`.
It has an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D (16 physical cores, 32 threads) and approximately
123.5 GiB RAM. In this campaign CPU IDs 0–15 each select a distinct physical
core. Recheck topology and competing workloads before a new batch.

Persistent files are under `/home/kooza/ukrmol/co-pilot`, mounted as `/work`:

- `runs/<name>/`: inputs, all UKRmol/Psi4 outputs, integrals, scratch, timing,
  resources and analysis; failed directories are retained.
- `batches/<manifest-stem>/`: manifests, commands, original exit codes, wall
  times and, for later batches, read-only source snapshots. The first four
  batches predate snapshotting; their hashes and generated run inputs remain.
- `upstream/`: UKRmol-scripts 1.0 archive and extracted sources.
- `qmodeling/`: the original deployed experiment source.
- `source-build-v5.log`: the original successful source build log.
- `pr-checkout/`: the packaged Docker build context; `packaged-build-coldcache.log`
  records its independent build/test verification.

The existing interactive `ukrmol-co-pilot` container was used for early setup;
finite fresh-container jobs are the reproducible execution interface. The
other observed container, `comfyui`, is unrelated to this experiment.

Historical images:

| Image | Recorded ID |
|---|---|
| Reference engine / original CO pilot | `sha256:e25463b7d4a3fa4ba268b2a621e9e9e895893d8826d5e22dc042c8f6f35b9bd8` |
| Original source engine | `sha256:599eeee919f56a27e6a0a4e214c5fc80a2f5780752f07b654b21fe1339f61ae6` |

These are local image IDs, not published registry digests. Rebuild elsewhere
using `docker/ukrmol-plus/Dockerfile` and record the new ID. Source checksums
and comparisons, not equality of rebuilt image bytes, are the evidence.

## Replaying the campaign

The committed JSON recipes name the jobs used for the quoted findings:

| Manifest | Question |
|---|---|
| `pilot-jobs.json` | Original three geometries and equilibrium SEP30 check |
| `calibration-freezing.json` | Two/four frozen A1 orbitals and DZ virtual-space growth |
| `calibration-basis-continuum.json` | Basis/virtual space, l cutoff, sphere, deletion and propagation |
| `calibration-continuum-retry.json` | Numerical-failure retries with deletion 1e-6 |
| `calibration-mpi.json` | One/two/four-rank timing at the same equilibrium model |
| `calibration-throughput.json` | Four independent one-rank jobs |
| `calibration-sentinels.json` | Compressed/stretched l=3/4 comparisons |
| `calibration-cc-hf.json` | CAS(10,8) HF-orbital CC40/CC80 diagnostics |
| `calibration-cc-casscf.json`, `calibration-cc-tz.json` | Ground-state-CASSCF CAS diagnostics and basis comparison |
| `calibration-cc-no-virtuals.json` | CAS(10,8) with no external virtuals |
| `calibration-cc-workspace.json` | Intermediate CAS(10,10) NDIMX-only workspace retry; failed |
| `calibration-cc-workspaces.json` | Successful CAS(10,10) runs with all workspaces raised |
| `calibration-source.json` | Source-engine differential check |
| `calibration-pairs.json` | 21 phase/fit comparisons; this is not a job manifest |

Copy the checkout to a new host directory, or use the packaged checkout on
Sadaharu. Give each repeat campaign a fresh root or fresh manifest/job names.
For example, on the host from the checkout root:

```bash
python3 -m projects.ukrmol_co.batch projects/ukrmol_co/calibration-cc-workspaces.json \
  --root /home/kooza/ukrmol/co-replay-001 \
  --image qmodeling/ukrmol-co:source --cpu-groups 0-3 4-7 8-11 --memory 24g
```

Prepare the new root with host-login and container-user write access. The
measured three-worker CAS(10,10) batch used 12 physical cores and finished in
15.1 minutes; the published cost forecast in the README is conditional on that
model size, not a budget for an accuracy-qualified state-averaged target.

The final runner sets `NDIMX=200000`, `CDIMX=NODIMX=20000`. Early manifests
refer to older snapshots with smaller or only partly corrected input limits.
Use the historical snapshot and templates to reproduce such failures; current
defaults intentionally execute the repaired configuration. Some original
nonzero batch codes were analyzer errors repaired after the engine succeeded;
`initial_batch_exit_code` retains this distinction in `calibration-results.json`.

Early batch source snapshots are absent for `calibration-freezing`,
`calibration-basis-continuum`, `calibration-continuum-retry` and
`calibration-cc-hf`. Their exact molecular decks, instrumented libraries,
templates, generated program inputs and outputs are included in the evidence;
do not claim that every historical Python harness revision is archived.

For a new aggregate, give `collect.py` fresh campaign metadata. For a historical
snapshot, use `campaign-provenance.json` as shown in the README. Native fits
remain in Hartree; the paired comparisons label their differences in eV.

## Next qualification gate

1. **Construct balanced orbitals.** Implement or import multi-spin/multi-irrep
   state-averaged CAS(10,10) or larger target orbitals. The existing `natural`
   option optimizes only the ground singlet. Verify excited target energies,
   dipoles, orbital/state identities and continuity as R changes.
2. **Check electronic convergence.** Compare DZ/TZ atomic bases, active/external
   spaces and about 40–50 C2v target components at R=1.9, 2.1323 and 2.5 bohr.
   Published values are plausibility checks with model-dependent spread, not
   error bars or a requirement to force agreement.
3. **Recheck continuum and extraction.** Start from radius 18 bohr, l=4, double
   precision and deletion 1e-6, then vary those controls and fit window/grid/
   background for the new electronic model. Use the provisional 0.05 eV,
   5% width (0.001 eV floor) and 0.05 rad modulo-π criteria from the README.
   Diagnose poles/bound states at threshold and track the same physical feature.
4. **Calculate a correlated neutral curve.** RHF pilot energies are not adequate
   nuclear-dynamics inputs. Keep the relative scattering resonance and the
   neutral curve's reference convention explicit.
5. **Remeasure cost, then cover geometry/energy.** Qualify the electronic model
   before the tentative 25–40-geometry, 300–800-energy campaign. Multi-day
   execution is acceptable. Use adaptive windows where fits narrow, and measure
   throughput/memory again at the selected model/channel size.
6. **Connect to potential fitting.** `projects/potential_factory/target.py`
   supplies neutral/resonance target holders; eigenphase fitting and the polar
   tail still need development. Fixed-nuclei data do not uniquely identify a
   local radial potential. HTTP and AWS execution are subsequent capabilities.
